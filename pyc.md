## yadm

Yet Another Dotfiles Manager
~~~~

~~~~
Yadm dotfile manager on steroids. Alternate file,
encryption, and bootstrap support

~~~
yadm is like having a version of Git, that only
operates on your dotfiles. If you know how to
use Git, you already know how to use yadm.

- It doesn’t matter if your current directory
  is another Git-managed repository
- You don’t have to move your dotfiles, or have
  them symlinked from another location.
- yadm automatically inherits all of Git’s
  features, allowing you to branch, merge, rebase, use
  submodules, etc
