Yet Another Dotfiles Manager

Yadm dotfile manager on steroids. Alternate file,

yadm is like having a version of Git, that only
operates on your dotfiles. If you know how to use
Git, you already know how to use yadm.

  another Git-managed repository
- You don’t have to move your dotfiles, or have
  them symlinked from another location.
- yadm automatically inherits all of Git’s features,
  allowing you to branch, merge, rebase, use submodules, etc
