First Level Header
==================

Second Level Header
-------------------

This is a simple paragraph of text, written in a

per line, like a plaintext email.

You can also write _emphasis_, or **strong**
emphasis, or even ***double-emphasis*** in your
text.

## An alternative way to mark 2nd Level Headers

> This is a blockquote. You can write entire paragraphs
> like that. Again, this is very similar to how emails
> are formatted and written.
> Consider markdown inspired by plain-text email.
>
> And some more text in this blockquote, of course you
> can again use _emphasis_, or **strong** emphasis, or
> even ***double-emphasis*** in your text. But wait,
> there's more!
